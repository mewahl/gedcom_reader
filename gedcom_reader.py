Extracts name, sex, and parentage information for each individual in the
GEDCOM file. Removes individuals who are more than a defined number of
meioses from a terminal node. Retains only individuals who remain connected
to a selected person of interest. Returns:
* gedcom_dict: key: GEDCOM id; value: list
  [0] Name
  [1] Sex ('M' or 'F')
  [2] Placeholder status (True if this is a dummy person inserted where no
	    information on a parent was available)
  [3] Person of Interest status (True if name contains substring used to define
	    person of interest)
* trio_dict: key: GEDCOM id; value: two-tuple
  [0] GEDCOM id of mother
  [1] GEDCOM id of father
